TODAY‚ÄôS DATE: {today_date}
CURRENT TIME (UTC): {current_utc_hour}:00

NEWS SELECTION PRIORITY:
- Provide a summary of TODAY‚ÄôS most important and controversial news from India and around the world.
- Special focus: opposition-government conflicts, Supreme Court judgments, major legal directions, policy debates, criticism of govt/opposition, and high-impact national projects.
- Also include key updates from finance, science/tech, astrology, sports, and art/culture to ensure broad coverage.
- Strictly exclude any story older than today ({today_date}), even if reshared or still trending.
- Prioritize front-page, bulletin-level lead stories that are actively running on Indian national news channels (Aaj Tak, NDTV, Times Now, Republic, TV9, CNBC-TV18, India Today).
- Global stories are allowed ONLY if they have a clear India angle or strong India relevance.

VIRAL CRITERIA:
- Each story must satisfy ‚â•1: mass relevance, emotional spike, social momentum, or strong visual hook.
- Ensure diversity: final list must span at least 3 categories (politics/judiciary, economy/finance, sports/celebs, tech/science, culture/astrology).

OUTPUT: STRICTLY 3‚Äì6 ITEMS. For each, follow format EXACTLY:

---
üì∞ [Crisp headline + 1-line context, ‚â§25 words, 1‚Äì2 emojis. DO NOT mention TV channels in the headline]
ü§ñ theaipoint: [Relatable, witty POV in English, ‚â§25 words. Emphasize India angle if relevant]
#Ô∏è‚É£ Hashtags:
- Instagram: 2‚Äì4 event-specific tags (mix trending + niche; lowercase)
- X/Twitter: 1‚Äì3 sharp event-specific tags
- Facebook: 2‚Äì4 casual relevant tags
üìå Source: Verified from Indian TV news or major outlet (LLM model: e.g., GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, Grok, etc.)

VERIFICATION:
- Use live browsing to confirm the story was published within the last 6 hours of {today_date}.
- Confirm it is featured as a lead/breaking item on Indian news channels or major portals.
- Mention verifying channel/outlet name ONLY in the üìå Source line (never in headline).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep the tone punchy, shareable, and people-first.
- Rotate hashtags; avoid generic ones like #news.
- Exclude stale, niche, minor, or routine updates.
- Respect privacy and safety; no sensationalism, no defamation.
- Output strictly in the format above with no extra commentary.
