üñºÔ∏è Stock Images:
Provide exactly 5 unique Unsplash or Pexels PHOTO PAGE URLs that directly match the headline theme. 
List them with numbers 1‚Äì5.

Rules for image selection:
1. Always use photo page URLs only (e.g., unsplash.com/photos/<id> or pexels.com/photo/<id>).
2. URLs must be visually relevant to the headline keywords (finance ‚Üí rupee notes, trading screens; cricket ‚Üí bat, ball, stumps, stadium; tech ‚Üí gadgets, AI visuals, chips; politics ‚Üí parliament, government buildings, flags; disasters ‚Üí landscapes, weather effects).
3. Each of the 5 URLs must represent different visual angles or concepts (e.g., wide shot, close-up, abstract, symbolic object, environment).
4. Absolutely avoid repetition across multiple news items in the same output.
5. Do not include people, faces, logos, or watermarked images.
6. If no perfect match exists, choose a symbolic or abstract visual metaphor that still fits (e.g., cracked earth for climate, chain links for trade tensions).
